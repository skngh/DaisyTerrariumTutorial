*This is the github repository for a video tutorial seen here*

## What's included

- **TutorialFlangerPedal:** Flanger pedal meant for the TerrariumPCB (or Daisy Petal), with 3 changeable parameters.

- **TutorialFlangerSeed:** The same flanger pedal but converted over for the Daisy Seed. To use, 3 knobs will have to be hooked up A0, A1, A2, and a button to A3. If you need help, [here is the documentation for how to hook up analog inputs](https://electro-smith.github.io/libDaisy/md_doc_md__a4__getting__started__a_d_cs.html).

- **TerrariumMultiEffect:** A multi effect pedal for the TerrariumPCB that I wrote. Featuring a delay, flanger, bitcrusher, and distortion.

- **terrarium.h:** This is the header file to make programming the correct analog inputs on the TerrariumPCB easier.

Details on how to use each script can be found in their respective readme files.

### Note:

The included folders must be put in the DaisyExamples folder to work. You may have to change the "Makefile" file and the "Library locations" section.
